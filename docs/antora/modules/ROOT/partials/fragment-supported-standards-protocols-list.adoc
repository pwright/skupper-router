* Version 1.0 of the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP)
* Modern TCP with IPv6
* Client compatibility

{RouterName} should, in theory, work with any client that is compatible with AMQP 1.0. The following clients have been tested:

qpid::messaging::
The Qpid messaging clients work with {RouterName} as long as they are configured to use the 1.0 version of the protocol. To enable AMQP 1.0 in the C++ client, use the `\{protocol:amqp1.0}` connection option.

Proton Reactor::
The Proton Reactor API is compatible with {RouterName}.

Proton Messenger::
Messenger works with {RouterName}.
