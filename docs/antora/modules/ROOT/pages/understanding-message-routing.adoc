= Understanding message routing

With message routing, routing is performed on messages as producers send them to a router. When a message arrives on a router, the router routes the message and its _settlement_ based on the message's _address_ and _routing pattern_.

= Message routing flow control

{RouterName} uses a _credit-based_ flow control mechanism to ensure that producers can only send messages to a router if at least one consumer is available to receive them. Because {RouterName} does not store messages, this credit-based flow control prevents producers from sending messages when there are no consumers present.

A client wishing to send a message to the router must wait until the router has provided it with credit. Attempting to publish a message without credit available will cause the client to block. Once credit is made available, the client will unblock, and the message will be sent to the router.

NOTE: Most AMQP client libraries enable you to determine the amount of credit available to a producer. For more information, consult your client's documentation.

[id='addresses-message-routing-{context}']
= Addresses

Addresses determine how messages flow through your router network. An address designates an endpoint in your messaging network, such as:

* Endpoint processes that consume data or offer a service
* Topics that match multiple consumers to multiple producers
* Entities within a messaging broker:
** Queues
** Durable Topics
** Exchanges

When a router receives a message, it uses the message's address to determine where to send the message (either its destination or one step closer to its destination).

{RouterName} considers addresses to be _mobile_ in that any user of an address may be directly connected to any router in the router network and may even
move around the topology. In cases where messages are broadcast to or
balanced across multiple consumers, the users of the address may be connected to multiple routers in the network.

Mobile addresses may be discovered during normal router operation or
configured through management settings.

[id='routing-patterns-message-routing-{context}']
= Routing patterns

Routing patterns define the paths that a message with a mobile address
can take across a network. These routing patterns can be used for both
direct routing, in which the router distributes messages between
clients without a broker, and indirect routing, in which the router
enables clients to exchange messages through a broker.

Routing patterns fall into two categories: Anycast
(Balanced and Closest) and Multicast. There is no concept of
"unicast" in which there is only one consumer for an address.

Anycast distribution delivers each message to one consumer whereas
multicast distribution delivers each message to all consumers.

Each address has one of the following routing patterns, which define the path that a message with the address can take across the messaging network:

Balanced:: An anycast method that allows multiple consumers to use the same address. Each message is delivered to a single consumer only, and {RouterName} attempts to balance the traffic load across the router network.
+
--
If multiple consumers are attached to the same address, each router determines which outbound path should receive a message by considering each path's current number of unsettled deliveries. This means that more messages will be delivered along paths where deliveries are settled at higher rates.

[NOTE]
====
{RouterName} neither measures nor uses message settlement time to determine which outbound path to use.
====

In this scenario, the messages are spread across both receivers regardless of path length:

.Balanced Message Routing
image::balanced-routing.png[Balanced Message Routing, align="center"]
--

Closest:: An anycast method in which every message is sent along the shortest path to reach the destination, even if there are other consumers for the same address.
+
{RouterName} determines the shortest path based on the topology cost to reach each of the consumers. If there are multiple consumers with the same lowest cost, messages will be spread evenly among those consumers.
+
In this scenario, all messages sent by `Sender` will be delivered to `Receiver 1`:
+
.Closest Message Routing

Multicast:: Messages are sent to all consumers attached to the address. Each consumer will receive one copy of the message.
+
In this scenario, all messages are sent to all receivers:

[id='message-settlement-reliability-message-routing-{context}']
= Message settlement and reliability

{RouterName} can deliver messages with the following degrees of reliability:

* At most once
* At least once
* Exactly once

The level of reliability is negotiated between the producer and the router when the producer establishes a link to the router. To achieve the negotiated level of reliability, {RouterName} treats all messages as either _pre-settled_ or _unsettled_.

Pre-settled::
Sometimes called _fire and forget_, the router settles the incoming and outgoing deliveries and propagates the settlement to the message's destination. However, it does not guarantee delivery.

Unsettled::
{RouterName} propagates the settlement between the producer and consumer. For an anycast address, the router associates the incoming delivery with the resulting outgoing delivery. Based on this association, the router propagates changes in delivery state from the consumer to the producer.
+
For a multicast address, the router associates the incoming delivery with all outbound deliveries. The router waits for each consumer to set their delivery's final state. After all outgoing deliveries have reached their final state, the router sets a final delivery state for the original inbound delivery and passes it to the producer.
+
The following table describes the reliability guarantees for unsettled messages sent to an anycast or multicast address:
+
[cols="20,40,40"]
|===
| Final disposition | Anycast | Multicast

| `accepted`
| The consumer accepted the message.
| At least one consumer accepted the message, but no consumers rejected it.

| `released`
| The message did not reach its destination.
| The message did not reach any of the consumers.

| `modified`
| The message may or may not have reached its destination. The delivery is considered to be "in-doubt" and should be re-sent if "at least once" delivery is required.
| The message may or may not have reached any of the consumers. However, no consumers rejected or accepted it.

| `rejected`
| The consumer rejected the message.
| At least one consumer rejected the message.
