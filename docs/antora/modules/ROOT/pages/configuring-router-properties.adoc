[id='configuring-router-properties-{context}']
= Configuring router properties

By default, {RouterName} operates in `standalone` mode with a randomly-generated ID. If you want to use this router in a router network, you must change these properties.

.Procedure

include::{FragmentDir}/fragment-router-open-config-file-step.adoc[]

. In the `router` section, specify the mode and ID.
+
--
This example shows a router configured to operate in `interior` mode:

[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
router {
    mode: interior
    id: Router.A
}
----

`mode`:: Specify one of the following modes:
+
* `standalone` - Use this mode if the router does not communicate with
other routers and is not part of a router network. When operating in
this mode, the router only routes messages between directly connected
endpoints.
* `interior` - Use this mode if the router is part of a router network
and needs to collaborate with other routers.
* `edge` - Use this mode if the router is an edge router that will
connect to a network of interior routers.

`id`:: The unique
identifier for the router. This ID will also be the container name at
the AMQP protocol level.
--

. If necessary, configure any additional properties for the router.
