[id='syntax-using-qdstat-{context}']
= Syntax for using `qdstat`

You can use `qdstat` with the following syntax:

[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ qdstat __<option>__ [__<connection-options>__] [__<secure-connection-options>__]
----

This specifies:

* An _option_ for the type of information to view.
* One or more optional _connection options_ to specify a router for which to view the information.
+
If you do not specify a connection option, `qdstat` connects to the router listening on localhost and the default AMQP port (5672).
* The _secure connection options_ if the router for which you want to view information only accepts secure connections.

.Additional resources

* For more information about `qdstat`, see the {qdstatManPageLink}.

[id='commands-monitoring-router-network-{context}']
= Commands for monitoring the router network

You can use `qdstat` to view the status of routers on your router network. For example, you can view information about the attached links and configured addresses, available connections, and nodes in the router network.

| To... | Use this command...

| Create a state dump containing all statistics for all routers

A state dump shows the current operational state of the router network.
a|
[options="nowrap"]
----
$ qdstat --all-routers --all-entities
----

If you run this command on an interior router, it displays the statistics for all interior routers. If you run the command on an edge router, it displays the statistics for only that edge router.

| Create a state dump containing a single statistic for all routers
a|
[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ qdstat -l\|-a\|-c\|--autolinks\|--linkroutes\|-g\|-m --all-routers
----

If you run this command on an interior router, it displays the statistic for all interior routers. If you run the command on an edge router, it displays the statistic for only that edge router.

| Create a state dump containing all statistics for a single router
a|
[options="nowrap"]
----
$ qdstat --all-entities
----

This command shows the statistics for the local router only.
