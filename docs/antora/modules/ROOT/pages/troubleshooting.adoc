[id='viewing-log-entries-{context}']
= Viewing log entries

You may need to view log entries to diagnose errors, performance problems, and other important issues. A log entry consists of an optional timestamp, the logging module, the logging level, and the log message.

.Procedure

* Do one of the following:

** View log entries on the console.
+
By default, events are logged to the console, and you can view them there. However, if the `output` attribute is set for a particular logging module, then you can find those log entries in the specified location (`stderr`, `syslog`, or a file).

** Use the *`qdstat --log`* command to view recent log entries.
+
--
You can use the `--limit` parameter to limit the number of log entries that are displayed. For more information about `qdstat`, see {qdstatManPageLink}.

This example displays the last three log entries for `Router.A`:

[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ qdstat --log --limit=3 -r ROUTER.A
Wed Jun  7 17:49:32 2019 ROUTER (none) Core action 'link_deliver'
Wed Jun  7 17:49:32 2019 ROUTER (none) Core action 'send_to'
Wed Jun  7 17:49:32 2019 SERVER (none) [2]:0 -> @flow(19) [next-incoming-id=1, incoming-window=61, next-outgoing-id=0, outgoing-window=2147483647, handle=0, delivery-count=1, link-credit=250, drain=false]
----
--

NOTE: `vhost` entries are only populated if `multiTenant` is set to `true` in the `{RouterConfigFile}` configuration file.

[id='troubleshooting-using-logs-{context}']
= Troubleshooting using logs

You can use {RouterName} log entries to help diagnose error and performance issues with the routers in your network.

.Troubleshooting connections and links
====
In this example, `ROUTER` logs show the lifecycle of a connection and a link that is associated with it.

[options="nowrap"]
----
2019-04-05 14:54:38.037248 -0400 ROUTER (info) [C1] Connection Opened: dir=in host=127.0.0.1:55440 vhost= encrypted=no auth=no user=anonymous container_id=95e55424-6c0a-4a5c-8848-65a3ea5cc25a props= // <1>
2019-04-05 14:54:38.038137 -0400 ROUTER (info) [C1][L6] Link attached: dir=in source={<none> expire:sess} target={$management expire:sess} // <2>
2019-04-05 14:54:38.041103 -0400 ROUTER (info) [C1][L6] Link lost: del=1 presett=0 psdrop=0 acc=1 rej=0 rel=0 mod=0 delay1=0 delay10=0 // <3>
2019-04-05 14:54:38.041154 -0400 ROUTER (info) [C1] Connection Closed // <4>
----
<1> The connection is opened. Each connection has a unique ID (`C1`). The log also shows some information about the connection.
<2> A link is attached over the connection. The link is identified with a unique ID (`L6`). The log also shows the direction of the link, and the source and target addresses.
<3> The link is detached. The log shows the link's terminal statistics.
<4> The connection is closed.

NOTE: If necessary, you can use `qdmanage` to enable protocol-level trace logging for a particular connection. You can use this to trace the AMQP frames. For example:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ qdmanage update --type=connection --id=C1 enableProtocolTrace=true
----
====

.Troubleshooting the network topology
====
In this example, on `Router.A`, the `ROUTER_HELLO` logs show that it is connected to `Router.B`, and that `Router.B` is connected to `Router.A` and `Router.C`:

[options="nowrap"]
----
Tue Jun  7 13:50:21 2016 ROUTER_HELLO (trace) RCVD: HELLO(id=Router.B area=0 inst=1465307413 seen=['Router.A', 'Router.C']) // <1>
Tue Jun  7 13:50:21 2016 ROUTER_HELLO (trace) SENT: HELLO(id=Router.A area=0 inst=1465307416 seen=['Router.B']) // <2>
Tue Jun  7 13:50:22 2016 ROUTER_HELLO (trace) RCVD: HELLO(id=Router.B area=0 inst=1465307413 seen=['Router.A', 'Router.C'])
Tue Jun  7 13:50:22 2016 ROUTER_HELLO (trace) SENT: HELLO(id=Router.A area=0 inst=1465307416 seen=['Router.B'])
----
<1> `Router.A` received a Hello message from `Router.B`, which can see `Router.A` and `Router.C`.
<2> `Router.A` sent a Hello message to `Router.B`, which is the only router it can see.

On `Router.B`, the `ROUTER_HELLO` log shows the same router topology from a different perspective:

[options="nowrap"]
----
Tue Jun  7 13:50:18 2016 ROUTER_HELLO (trace) SENT: HELLO(id=Router.B area=0 inst=1465307413 seen=['Router.A', 'Router.C']) // <1>
Tue Jun  7 13:50:18 2016 ROUTER_HELLO (trace) RCVD: HELLO(id=Router.A area=0 inst=1465307416 seen=['Router.B']) // <2>
Tue Jun  7 13:50:19 2016 ROUTER_HELLO (trace) RCVD: HELLO(id=Router.C area=0 inst=1465307411 seen=['Router.B']) // <3>
----
<1> `Router.B` sent a Hello message to `Router.A` and `Router.C`.
<2> `Router.B` received a Hello message from `Router.A`, which can only see `Router.B`.
<3> `Router.B` received a Hello message from `Router.C`, which can only see `Router.B`.
====

.Tracing the link state between routers
====
Periodically, each router sends a Link State Request (LSR) to the other routers and receives a Link State Update (LSU) with the requested information. Exchanging the above information, each router can compute the next hops in the topology, and the related costs.

In this example, the `ROUTER_LS` logs show the RA, LSR, and LSU messages sent between three routers:

[options="nowrap"]
----
Tue Jun  7 14:10:02 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) SENT: LSR(id=Router.A area=0) to: Router.C
Tue Jun  7 14:10:02 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) SENT: LSR(id=Router.A area=0) to: Router.B
Tue Jun  7 14:10:02 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) SENT: RA(id=Router.A area=0 inst=1465308600 ls_seq=1 mobile_seq=1) // <1>
Tue Jun  7 14:10:02 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) RCVD: LSU(id=Router.B area=0 inst=1465308595 ls_seq=2 ls=LS(id=Router.B area=0 ls_seq=2 peers={'Router.A': 1L, 'Router.C': 1L})) // <2>
Tue Jun  7 14:10:02 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) RCVD: LSR(id=Router.B area=0)
Tue Jun  7 14:10:02 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) SENT: LSU(id=Router.A area=0 inst=1465308600 ls_seq=1 ls=LS(id=Router.A area=0 ls_seq=1 peers={'Router.B': 1}))
Tue Jun  7 14:10:02 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) RCVD: RA(id=Router.C area=0 inst=1465308592 ls_seq=1 mobile_seq=0)
Tue Jun  7 14:10:02 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) SENT: LSR(id=Router.A area=0) to: Router.C
Tue Jun  7 14:10:02 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) RCVD: LSR(id=Router.C area=0) // <3>
Tue Jun  7 14:10:02 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) SENT: LSU(id=Router.A area=0 inst=1465308600 ls_seq=1 ls=LS(id=Router.A area=0 ls_seq=1 peers={'Router.B': 1}))
Tue Jun  7 14:10:02 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) RCVD: LSU(id=Router.C area=0 inst=1465308592 ls_seq=1 ls=LS(id=Router.C area=0 ls_seq=1 peers={'Router.B': 1L})) // <4>
Tue Jun  7 14:10:03 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) Computed next hops: {'Router.C': 'Router.B', 'Router.B': 'Router.B'} // <5>
Tue Jun  7 14:10:03 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) Computed costs: {'Router.C': 2L, 'Router.B': 1}
Tue Jun  7 14:10:03 2016 ROUTER_LS (trace) Computed valid origins: {'Router.C': [], 'Router.B': []}
----
<1> `Router.A` sent LSR requests and an RA advertisement to the other routers on the network.
<2> `Router.A` received an LSU from `Router.B`, which has two peers: `Router.A`, and `Router.C` (with a cost of `1`).
<3> `Router.A` received an LSR from both `Router.B` and `Router.C`, and  replied with an LSU.
<4> `Router.A` received an LSU from `Router.C`, which only has one peer: `Router.B` (with a cost of `1`).
<5> After the LSR and LSU messages are exchanged, `Router.A` computed the router topology with the related costs.
====

.Tracing the state of mobile addresses attached to a router
====
In this example, the `ROUTER_MA` logs show the Mobile Address Request (MAR) and Mobile Address Update (MAU) messages sent between three routers:

[options="nowrap"]
----
Tue Jun  7 14:27:20 2016 ROUTER_MA (trace) SENT: MAU(id=Router.A area=0 mobile_seq=1 add=['Cmy_queue', 'Dmy_queue', 'M0my_queue_wp'] del=[]) // <1>
Tue Jun  7 14:27:21 2016 ROUTER_MA (trace) RCVD: MAR(id=Router.C area=0 have_seq=0) // <2>
Tue Jun  7 14:27:21 2016 ROUTER_MA (trace) SENT: MAU(id=Router.A area=0 mobile_seq=1 add=['Cmy_queue', 'Dmy_queue', 'M0my_queue_wp'] del=[])
Tue Jun  7 14:27:22 2016 ROUTER_MA (trace) RCVD: MAR(id=Router.B area=0 have_seq=0) // <3>
Tue Jun  7 14:27:22 2016 ROUTER_MA (trace) SENT: MAU(id=Router.A area=0 mobile_seq=1 add=['Cmy_queue', 'Dmy_queue', 'M0my_queue_wp'] del=[])
Tue Jun  7 14:27:39 2016 ROUTER_MA (trace) RCVD: MAU(id=Router.C area=0 mobile_seq=1 add=['M0my_test'] del=[]) // <4>
Tue Jun  7 14:27:51 2016 ROUTER_MA (trace) RCVD: MAU(id=Router.C area=0 mobile_seq=2 add=[] del=['M0my_test']) // <5>
----
<1> `Router.A` sent MAU messages to the other routers in the network to notify them about the addresses added for `my_queue` and `my_queue_wp`.
<2> `Router.A` received a MAR message in response from `Router.C`.
<3> `Router.A` received another MAR message in response from `Router.B`.
<4> `Router.C` sent a MAU message to notify the other routers that it added and address for `my_test`.
<5> `Router.C` sent another MAU message to notify the other routers that it deleted the address for `my_test` (because the receiver is detached).
====

.Finding information about messages sent and received by a router
====
In this example, the `MESSAGE` logs show that `Router.A` has sent and received some messages related to the Hello protocol, and sent and received some other messages on a link for a mobile address:

[options="nowrap"]

.Tracking configuration changes to a router
====
In this example, the `AGENT` logs show that on `Router.A`, `address`, `linkRoute`, and `autoLink` entities were added to the router's configuration file. When the router was started, the `AGENT` module applied these changes, and they are now viewable in the log:

[options="nowrap"]
----
Tue Jun  7 15:07:32 2016 AGENT (debug) Add entity: ConnectorEntity(addr=127.0.0.1, allowRedirect=True, cost=1, host=127.0.0.1, identity=connector/127.0.0.1:5672:BROKER, idleTimeoutSeconds=16, maxFrameSize=65536, name=BROKER, port=5672, role=route-container, stripAnnotations=both, type=org.apache.qpid.dispatch.connector, verifyHostname=True)

.Troubleshooting policy and vhost access rules
====
In this example, the `POLICY` logs show that this router has no limits on maximum connections, and the default application policy is disabled:

[options="nowrap"]
----
Tue Jun  7 15:07:32 2016 POLICY (info) Policy configured maximumConnections: 0, policyFolder: '', access rules enabled: 'false'
Tue Jun  7 15:07:32 2016 POLICY (info) Policy fallback defaultApplication is disabled
----
====

.Diagnosing errors
====
In this example, the `ERROR` logs show that the router failed to start when an incorrect path was specified for the router's configuration file:

[options="nowrap"]
