[id='starting-router-{context}']
= Starting a router

You use the `qdrouterd` command to start a router. You can start a router in the foreground, the background, or as a service.

.Procedure

* Do one of the following:

--
[cols="30,70"]
|===
| To... | Enter this command...

| Start the router in the foreground
a|
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ qdrouterd
----

| Start the router in the background as a daemon
a|
[source,bash,options="nowrap"]
----
$ qdrouterd -d
----

| Start the router as a service
a|
include::partial$fragment-start-router-service-command.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
If you start the router as a service, the `systemd` `LimitNOFILE` limit affects the number of connections that can be open for the router. If you reach the limit, the router is not able to accept any more connections, and an error message is logged indicating "Too many open files". To avoid reaching this limit, increase the `LimitNOFILE` value for the `systemd` process.

[id='changing-router-configuration-{context}']
= Changing a router's configuration

You can make a permanent change to a router's configuration by editing the router's configuration file directly. You must restart the router for the changes to take effect, but the changes will be saved even if the router is stopped.

.Procedure

. Do one of the following:
+
--
** Edit the default configuration file (`{RouterConfigFile}`).
** Create a new configuration file.
--

. Start (or restart) the router.
+
--
For more information, see xref:starting-router-{context}[].

If you created a new configuration file, you must specify the path using the `--conf` parameter. For example, the following command starts the router with a non-default configuration file:

[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ qdrouterd -d --conf /etc/qpid-dispatch/new-configuration-file.conf
----
--
