= Managing using `qdmanage`

The `qdmanage` tool is a command-line tool for viewing and modifying the configuration of a running router at runtime.

[NOTE]
====
If you make a change to a router using `qdmanage`, the change takes effect immediately, but is lost if the router is stopped. If you want to make a permanent change to a router's configuration, you must edit the router's `{RouterConfigFile}` configuration file.
====

You can use `qdmanage` with the following syntax:

[options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]
----
$ qdmanage [__<connection-options>__] __<operation>__ [__<options>__]
----

This specifies:

* One or more optional _connection options_ to specify the router on which to perform the operation, or to supply security credentials if the router only accepts secure connections.
+
If you do not specify any connection options, `qdmanage` connects to the router listening on localhost and the default AMQP port (5672).
* The _operation_ to perform on the router.
* One or more optional _options_ to specify a configuration entity on which to perform the operation or how to format the command output.

When you enter a `qdmanage` command, it is executed as an AMQP management operation request, and then the response is returned as command output in JSON format.

For example, the following command executes a query operation on a router, and then returns the response in JSON format:

[options="nowrap"]
----
$ qdmanage query --type listener
